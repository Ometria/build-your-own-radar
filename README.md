A library that generates an interactive radar, inspired by [thoughtworks.com/radar](http://thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Demo

You can see this in action at https://radar.thoughtworks.com. If you plug in [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18A7oDuavlh89rAmqcaXpqle8QLqIvlAkoEUxcObzuUM/edit#gid=1985253373) you'll see [this visualization](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F18A7oDuavlh89rAmqcaXpqle8QLqIvlAkoEUxcObzuUM%2Fedit%23gid%3D1985253373). 

## How To Use - Ometria version

Unlike the original project, which uses an external public data source, our version generates a static website with the data bundled together.

For git-based collaboration, the radar is currently reading its data from markdown files (and the folder structure) in the filesystem, inside the `/data` directory. This will allow pull request that add or removes nodes from the radar as files, which I think may work quite well.

Inside `/data` there's a folder for each quadrant and inside those a `index.md` with the human readable name/label for the quadrant and the markdown files for the nodes inside the quadrant. They're named with the stage as a prefix, ie `adopt-kubernetes.md`. We could easily pop the stage information inside the md file as well but maybe this is a feature as it will group techs in the same stage together, alphabetically. Inside each md file there's a line for title, a optional one to indicate if it's a new entry, and then the description (which supports markdown tags).

In the end, a CSV is generated in this format:

```
name,ring,quadrant,isNew,description  
Composer,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Although the idea of dependency management ..."  
Canary builds,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Many projects have external code dependencies ..."  
Apache Kylin,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Apache Kylin is an open source analytics solution ..."  
JSF,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF ..."  
```

***Note:*** The CSV file parsing is using D3 library, so consult the D3 documentation for the data format details.

## Docker Image

We have released BYOR as a docker image for our users. The image is available in our [DockerHub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar/). To pull and run the image, run the following commands.

```
$ docker pull wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e SERVER_NAMES="localhost 127.0.0.1" wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar
$ open http://localhost:8080
```

## Contribute

All tasks are defined in `package.json`.

Pull requests are welcome; please write tests whenever possible. 
Make sure you have nodejs installed.

- `git clone git@github.com:thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm test` - to run your tests
- `npm run dev` - to run application in localhost:8080. This will watch the .js and .css files and rebuild on file changes

***Note***: If you are facing google authentication error, need to set the `Google API_KEY` and `OAuth CLIENT_ID` before starting the app server. To bypass this add `SKIP_GOOGLE_AUTH=true` ENV variable along with `npm run dev`.

To run End to End tests in headless mode
- add a new environment variable 'TEST_URL' and set it to 'http://localhost:8080/'
- `npm run end_to_end_test`

To run End to End tests in debug mode
- add a new environment variable 'TEST_URL' and set it to 'http://localhost:8080/'
- `npm run start`
- Click on 'Run all specs' in cypress window

### Don't want to install node? Run with one line docker

     $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it node:10.15.3 /bin/sh -c 'npm install && npm run dev'

***Note***: If you are facing Node-sass compile error while running, please prefix the command `npm rebuild node-sass` before `npm run dev`. like this
```
npm install && npm rebuild node-sass && npm run dev
```

After building it will start on `localhost:8080`
